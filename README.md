#  Create Multiple Passwords
Passwords with different complexity levels:
Weak: apple123
Medium: Apple2025
Strong: ApPLe@2025!
Very Strong: Gr33n_P@rrot!_42
Extra Strong (Random): 7h!S_I$_V3ry$tr0nG%2025
#  Test Each Password
Open a free online password checker:

Enter each password (do not use real passwords you actually use)
Password	Score (%)	Feedback
apple123	34%	Too short, lacks symbols, predictable
Apple2025	54%	Add special characters
ApPLe@2025!	88%	Good strength, could be longer
Gr33n_P@rrot!_42	100%	Excellent
7h!S_I$_V3ry$tr0nG%2025	100%	Very strong, random and long
# Identify Best Practices
The strong passwords:
Are at least 12–16 characters long.
Use upper + lower case letters.
Include numbers and symbols.
Avoid common words or personal info.
Are random or passphrases.
# Common Password Attacks
1. Brute Force Attack
How it works:
The attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
Example:
Trying a, aa, aaa, … until the password matches.
Weakness exploited:
Short and simple passwords.
Defense:
Use long, complex passwords; enable account lockouts after failed attempts; use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
2. Dictionary Attack
How it works:
The attacker uses a predefined list of common passwords and words, often from leaked data, to guess the password.
Example:
Trying password, 123456, letmein, qwerty, etc.
Weakness exploited:
Predictable passwords based on common words or patterns.
Defense:
Avoid common words; use random strings or unique passphrases.
# Summary
Complex passwords drastically increase the time and computing power required for brute-force and dictionary attacks. Every additional character exponentially increases the possible combinations, making guessing far more difficult. Using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols further strengthens security. Randomness in password creation, combined with avoiding personal information or predictable patterns, significantly reduces vulnerability. Unique passwords for each account and the use of multi-factor authentication provide an additional layer of defense against credential stuffing and other password-based attacks.
